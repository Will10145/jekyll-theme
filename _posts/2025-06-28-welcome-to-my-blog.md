Welcome to my new Jekyll blog! This is my first post showcasing the beautiful card-based layout I've created.

## Features

This blog includes:

- **Card-based layout** - Posts are displayed as beautiful cards
- **Responsive design** - Works great on all devices
- **Light/Dark mode** - Toggle between themes
- **Smooth animations** - Elegant transitions and hover effects

## Getting Started

To create a new post, simply add a new file to the `_posts` directory with the filename format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.

```markdown
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2025-06-28 10:00:00 -0000
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
image: "path/to/your/image.jpg"
---

Your post content goes here!
```

The image field is optional - if you don't include it, the card will just show the title and excerpt.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance by editing the SCSS files in the `_sass` directory. The card styles are specifically in `_blog-cards.scss`.

Happy blogging! ðŸŽ‰
