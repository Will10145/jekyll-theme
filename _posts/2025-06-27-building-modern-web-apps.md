In this post, I'll walk you through the process of building modern web applications using the latest technologies and best practices.

## Modern Tech Stack

Today's web development landscape offers incredible tools:

### Frontend
- **React** or **Vue.js** for component-based UIs
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid styling
- **Vite** for lightning-fast development

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express or Fastify
- **Python** with FastAPI or Django
- **Go** for high-performance APIs

## Best Practices

1. **Component Architecture** - Build reusable, composable components
2. **State Management** - Use tools like Zustand or Redux Toolkit
3. **Testing** - Write tests with Jest, Vitest, or Cypress
4. **Performance** - Optimize with code splitting and lazy loading

## Example Component

Here's a simple React component with TypeScript:

```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  onClick?: () => void;
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ 
  children, 
  variant = 'primary', 
  onClick 
}) => {
  return (
    <button 
      className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

This approach gives you type safety, reusability, and clean code organization.

## Conclusion

Modern web development is more exciting than ever. With the right tools and practices, you can build incredible user experiences that are both performant and maintainable.
